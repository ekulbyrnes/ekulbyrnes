            <p>My name is Luke. I enjoy making websites and teaching others to do the same. I created ScoutHack to provide opportunities for young people to get an insight into real tech experiences while they have access to great mentors.</p>

            <p>ScoutHack is a fun and exciting program that teaches young people to build a simple website using HTML, CSS, and Python. JavaScript is avoided at all costs - website development shouldn't start with torture.</p>
